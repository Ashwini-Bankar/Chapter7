7.10 At the end of Section 7.10, we showed how a function canâ€™t return a pointer to an automatic variable. Is the following code correct?

int f1(int val)
{
	int num = 0;
	int *ptr = &num;
	if (val == 0) 
	{
		int val;
		val = 5;
		ptr = &val;
	}
	return(*ptr + 1);
}

ANS:
	The code is incorrect, since it references the automatic integer val through a pointer after the automatic variable is no longer in existence. Automatic variables declared after the left brace that starts a compound statement disappear after the matching right brace.
