7.3  Is there any way for a function that is called by main to examine the command-line arguments without (a) passing argc and argv as arguments from main to the function or (b) having main copy argc and argv into global variables?

ANS:
	On most UNIX systems, there is no way to do this. Copies of argc and argv are not kept in global variables like environ is.
