7.6  If we allocate an array of longs using calloc, is the array initialized to 0? If we allocate an array of pointers using calloc, is the array initialized to null pointers?

ANS:
	calloc initializes the memory that it allocates to all zero bits. ISO C does not guarantee that this is the same as either a floating-point 0 or a null pointer.
